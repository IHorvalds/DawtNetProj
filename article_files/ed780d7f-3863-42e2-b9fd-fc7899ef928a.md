# MySQL Should be pronounced just like *musical* {.chapter}

Here's why.

## First of all the letter y in a lor of northernlanguages is pronounced [ü](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_rounded_vowel). {.chapter}

So my could be *mü*.

## A lot of people pronounce SQL as *sequel*. {.chapter}

So therefore MySQL <=> musical.
